**CAPEAM** (Context-Aware Planning and Environment-Aware Memory) is an embodied instruction following agent that incorporates semantic context (e.g., appropriate objects to interact with) in a sequence of actions and maintains the changed spatial arrangement and states of interacted objects (e.g., location that the object has been moved to) in inferring the subsequent actions.
